libcsp-rust
========

This crate provides a (mostly) safe and ergonomic Rust API for the
[`libcsp` library](https://github.com/libcsp/libcsp) on top of the
[`libcsp-sys`](https://crates.io/crates/libcsp-sys) crate.

You can find some more high-level information and examples in the
[main repository](https://egit.irs.uni-stuttgart.de/rust/libcsp-rust).

The API documentation should provide all additional information required to use this library.
