libcsp-cargo-build
========

This crate provides a library to allow building the [`libcsp`](https://github.com/libcsp/libcsp)
with cargo. You can find some more high-level information and examples in the
[main workspace](https://egit.irs.uni-stuttgart.de/rust/libcsp-rust). The API documentation
should provide all additional advanced information you might require to tweak the `libcsp` build.
